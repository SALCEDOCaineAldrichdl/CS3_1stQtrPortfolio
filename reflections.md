List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.

• Topics that I can say I'm confident in 1st Quarter of CS3 are:
- Variable Declaration
  It is the naming of variables and initialization of values that are used to store values to utilize in the latter part of the code.
  It has keywords that can be used in this lesson, they are var, let, const. Through this, we can store values and eventually utilize them all over again
  for other parts of our code.
- Control Statements
  Control statements are True or False statements that can be used to a loop in a code. This topic lets you control the flow of your code on certain
  conditions and loops. It helps the code make decisions repeat actions if the condition is met, or choose between paths of the code.
- JavaScript Operations
  these are the actions that lets you manipulate, compare, calculate, and assign in the code.
  It generally makes your code functioning, because without it, it won't be able to compare, calculate etc things you want to do in your code.
- JavaScript Basic Statements
  JavaScript Basic Statements are individual instructions that the browser executes to perform tasks like a=declaring variables,
  make decisions, repeat actions. Common keywords include let, if, for (loops) used to repeat a block of code.
- Loop Control Structures
  are used to repeat a block of code multiple times, either a set number of times or until a condition is no longer true. Common loop types are for,
  while, and do while, and they help utilize repetitive tasks efficiently.
• Topics that I can say I'm not confident in 1st Quarter of CS3 are:
  - Nesting loop structures
    I still don't know how I will integrate the variables in nesting loop structures. I struggle with the placements of the console logs so that
    I can output my answer, and sometimes I forget to redeclare variables needed in that loop which makes errors in my codes.
  - Processing Function outputs
    I still get confused on how the functions return their values in order to output the output properly.
    I also struggle on how to eventually utilize those outputs to other parts of my code which makes my code wrong most of the times.
  - Event Handlers
    It makes it hard for me because I forget the keywords to use in those parts. And sometimes I do remember what the keywords are but don't know how
    use it properly and efficiently.
  These are the only things I struggle on this subject.

Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

I will study more and spend a lot more time than I usually spend for the topics I find really hard in this subject. 
I will ask for help to people that knows how to do it and understands the topics. Also I will utilize the consultation you give us and ask questions 
in order to understand the topics.

In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

- Javascript operations
  are very useful because they are the foundations in order to code properly and function properly. They are used to perform most of the things we want to make
  possible in our code.
- Variable Declaration
  They are useful because they initialize the variables where you can store the data needed for the code.
